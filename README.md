# Bit Mascot Training Program

This is a project developed as part of the Bit Mascot training program. It focuses on building a web application using the following technologies:

- Groovy (programming language)
- Grails 6.0 (Framework)
- MySQL (Database)
- GORM (Grails Object Relational Mapping)
- GSP (Groovy Server Pages)


## Day 1

On the first day of the training program, the following tasks were completed:

- Project initialization: The project structure was set up to organize the code and resources effectively.

- Understanding domain classes and MVC architecture: The concept of domain classes, representing the data model, was learned. The MVC architecture, which separates the application into Model, View, and Controller components, was also explained.

- Member service, controller, and view: The Member service handles business logic related to members, while the Member controller manages requests and interacts with the service. The view (GSP file) is responsible for rendering the member-related user interface.

## Day 2

On the second day of the training program, the following tasks were completed:

- Database connectivity: The application was connected to a MySQL database to store member and contact group information.

- CRUD operations for Member: Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations were implemented for managing member records. These operations allow manipulating member data stored in the database.

- Authentication and authorization features: Authentication functionality was added to verify user credentials during login. Authorization was implemented to control access to certain actions based on user roles.

- Contact Group: A contact group feature was created to organize members into specific groups. Members could be associated with contact groups, and operations like adding, removing, and updating group members were provided.
